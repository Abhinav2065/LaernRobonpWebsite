            <p>
              Learn Robo Nepal was born from a simple observation: while the world was rapidly advancing 
              in technology, many young Nepali students lacked access to practical STEM education. 
              Founded in 2025 by Abhinav Siluwal.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are now just a small movement, just a couple of high school students working for a Change.
              We imagine Learn Robo Nepal to be a national wide movement, helping thousands of students in Nepal 
              and making dreams come true!
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, we continue to grow our community of learners and mentors, constantly evolving 
              our programs to meet the changing needs of the tech landscape while staying true to 
              our core mission of making STEM education accessible to all.
